## Rules
- Klondike Solitaire
    - To win a game of Klondike Solitaire, one must move every card to the four aces area. These cards must be of matching suits and go from Ace to King for all 4 suits.
- Pyramid Solitaire
    - To win a game of Pyramid Solitaire, one must remove all cards from the board. The deck does not need to be cleared as well. To clear a card, a match equal to 13 must be made. A king is cleared on its own.
- TriPeaks Solitaire
    - To win a game of TriPeaks Solitaire, one must remove all cards from the board. The deck does not need to be cleared as well. To clear a card, one must click a card that is one value above or below the current card. If there are no more matches, then one may either draw a new card or reset the game.
- FreeCell Solitaire
    - To win a game of FreeCell Solitaire, one must move all cards to the top right location. Also known as the Aces location. Only one card can be moved at one time. But the game will allow multiple cards to be moved if there is free space to move them.
- Spider Solitaire
    - To win a game of Spider Solitaire, one must complete runs from King to Ace until all cards are removed from the play area. The cards do not have to be drawn in order to win but that may help continue the game.
- BlackWar
    - To win a game of BlackWar, one must win more cards than any other player. Currently BlackWar is in Beta mode.

## About BlackWar
- Nichathan created BlackWar in 2022 one day to cure his wife's boredom. Shortly after, the idea of a new and unique card game expanded into this 6 pack card game.

    ### Typical Game:
    - A Typical BlackWar game is played with 2-4 players and is played with a single deck of 52 playing cards (Suits are irrelevant here).

    ### Setup:
    - To begin a game of BlackWar, the deck(s) is(are) evenly split between all players. Any cards that cannot be evenly distributed should be discarded and not used for the remainder of the game.

    ### A Typical Turn:
    - During a typical turn in BlackWar, all players must draw 2 cards. (A single card may be drawn if playing a No Refresh Game and there is only 1 card left in the players deck.) Once every player draws their cards, they may look at the cards of every other player. Then, each player may decide to continue drawing cards until they decide to stop or go over a hand count of 21.

    ### Deciding the winner of a turn:
    - Once every player has decided to stop drawing cards, whoever has a hand count under 22 and closest to 21 is the winner. At this point, if all players are over 21 cards then the winner will be whoever is closest to 21. If there are multiple winners then a single card is drawn and the winner is whoever is closest to 21. This last step can be repeated until a winner is found. In the unlikely chance that the players are playing a No Refresh Game and this causes them to tie but run out of cards, then every card not in the winnings or play decks are discarded, the game is stopped and the decks are counted to determine a winner.

    ### Game Modes
    - The game has two play modes, one is very quick and the other becomes a battle of attrition that may take from half an hour to several days.

        #### No Refresh Game:
        - The quick play mode is also known as a No Refresh Game in which the game is played until at least 1 player has used up their entire deck of cards. At this point, all players must merge their winnings deck, play deck, and hand. Then these cards are counted and whoever has the most is the winner. It is possible to have multiple winners or no winners. There are multiple winners if multiple players have the highest amount of cards and there is at least one winner. If all players have the same number of cards then there are no winners. In the case of a tie, a single tie breaking hand may be dealt to the tied winners and the winner of that hand is pronounced as the winner.

        #### Attrition Game:
        - The extended play mode is also known as an Attrition Game in which the game is played until all of the cards are owned by a single player. Once a players play deck runs out of cards, they flip over their winnings deck and it becomes their new play deck. This can be done during the players current turn or at the end of the turn. Players who run out of cards are eliminated and may not play again until a player owns every card or every other player has forfeit.

    ### Single Person Game:
    - The game is playable with a single person but then it is indistinguishable from single person BlackJack without the dealer. The goal is to get as close to 21 as possible before giving up and seeing how far you can push yourself.

    ### Large Party Game:
    - BlackWar can become a bit hectic with large groups of players but that can be part of the fun. The rules for the game do not change but it is recommended that a new deck is added for every 4 players (For the mathematical inclined, it looks more like [Number of players mod 4])

## About FreeCell
- A typical FreeCell game is played with a typical deck of 52 playing cards spread randomly throughout 8 locations.
- Every card is played face up and the first 4 rows have an extra card.

- There are 4 additional locations (Typically located at the top left of the play area) so that any single card can be placed there.
- There are also another 4 additional locations (Typically located at the top right of the play area) so that a string from Ace to King can be made.

- The game is won when all four Ace locations contain a stack of consecutive cards from Ace to King.

- A card may be moved by being dragged, or by clicking the card and then clicking the movement location.
- A group of cards may only be moved if there are enough empty spaces (out of the 4 to the top left and the original 8) to move each card in the stack 1 by 1 from top to bottom.
    - I.E. A group of 8,7 can be placed on top of a 9 in the original 8 locations iff there is at least 1  empty space in the free locations.
